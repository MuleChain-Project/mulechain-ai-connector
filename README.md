# MuleChain Connector for MuleSoft

Langchain4J is used as the base framework for this extension, which integrates Langchain4j capabilities into MuleSoft Platform.

𝘐𝘯𝘴𝘱𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘺 𝘓𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘪𝘯4𝘫, Dmytro Liubarskyi, and Lize Raes, we are launching an open-source project for MuleSoft called 𝑴𝒖𝒍𝒆𝑪𝒉𝒂𝒊𝒏. 

## Overview

 🚩 **𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧?**

MuleChain is a MuleSoft custom connector (𝘣𝘢𝘴𝘦𝘥 on 𝘓𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘪𝘯4𝘫) to provide a complete framework for MuleSoft users to design, build, and manage the lifecycle of AI Agents fully in the Anypoint Platform. 

📌 **𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧**
Enabled through LangChain4j, MuleChain will provide:

🔀**𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐢𝐝 𝐰𝐞 𝐚𝐝𝐝 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧4𝐣?**

MuleChain leverages the MuleSoft ecosystem to provide additional capabilities on top of the great LangChain4j project. 

✅ Dynamic tooling through a configuration file

✅ Flexible tooling through Anypoint Exchange

**Through MuleSoft Anypoint Platform**, we enabled:

✅ E2E Lifecycle Management for AI Agents

✅ Centralized design of AI Agents (Anypoint Design Center)

✅ AI Agent Portal (Exchange & Anypoint Experience Hub)

✅ Fully fledged AI Agent Monitoring (Anypoint Monitoring & Visualizer)

✅ Low Code IDE (Anypoint Studio & Anypoint Code Builder)

✅ Unit-testing framework (MUnit, currently only in Studio)

### Mule Palette Extension

![Palette](assets/connector_operations.png)

## Features

- **Language Models**: Integrate various language models provided by Langchain to generate text, perform language analysis, and handle complex language-based tasks.
- **Embeddings**: Utilize embedding models to transform text into numerical vectors for tasks such as text similarity, clustering, and search functionalities.
- **Tools Integration**: Incorporate APIs and other dynamic functionalities into MuleSoft, facilitating the use of external services and data processing tools.
- **Image Models**: Work with image models for tasks like image generation, recognition, and manipulation.
- **Streaming**: Support for real-time data processing and interaction with language models.

## Requirements

- The maximum supported version for Java SDK is JDK 17. You can use JDK 17 only for running your application.
- Compilation with Java SDK must be done with JDK 8.

## Installation

To use this connector, add the following dependency to your application's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mule.langchain</groupId>
    <artifactId>langchain-connector</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
```

## Getting Started

1.**Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langchain4mule.git
cd langchain4mule
```

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed, such as JDK 8 and Maven.

3. **Build the Project**:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Usage

### Example Mule Flow

Here's an example of how to use the Langchain connector in a Mule flow:

```xml
<flow name="exampleFlow">
    <langchain:config name="Langchain_Config" doc:name="Langchain Config"/>
    <langchain:execute name="Execute_Langchain_Model" doc:name="Execute Langchain Model">
        <langchain:model>exampleModel</langchain:model>
        <langchain:input>Example input text</langchain:input>
    </langchain:execute>
</flow>
```
